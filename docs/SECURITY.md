## Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to the project, keep these security best practices in mind:

- **Use secure coding practices** (e.g., validate inputs, escape outputs, avoid SQL/NoSQL injection).
- **Never commit sensitive data** (e.g., API keys, database credentials, JWT secrets).
- **Follow dependency updates** to avoid known security vulnerabilities.
- **Report suspicious activities** in the repo.

## Bug Bounty

While we don’t have a formal bug bounty program (yet!), we appreciate all security researchers who responsibly report vulnerabilities. If your report is valid and critical, we might offer you a **cool shoutout** and possibly **some exclusive Rooftime swag**! 🎉

## Final Note

Security is a shared responsibility. If you see something, say something. Let’s keep Rooftime secure for everyone. 🔒🚀
