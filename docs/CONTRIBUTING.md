# Contributing to Rooftime

Welcome, fellow code warrior! 🏆 We appreciate your interest in contributing to Rooftime. Whether you're here to squash bugs, optimize performance, or add epic new features, you're in the right place. Read on to ensure your contributions fit seamlessly into the project.

## 🛠 Setting Up the Project

First, fork the repository and clone your fork locally:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mmycin/Rooftime-App.git
$ cd Rooftime-App
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
$ bun install
```

Run the project in development mode:
```sh
$ bun run dev
```

## 🎯 How to Contribute

### 1. Issues First! 🔍
Before coding, check the [Issues](https://github.com/mmycin/Rooftime-App/issues) tab to see if your feature/bug is already being discussed. If not, create a new issue to describe your idea.

### 2. Follow the Code Style 🎨
- Use TypeScript consistently.
- Keep formatting clean with Prettier and ESLint.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.

### 3. Branching & Commits 🌱
- Create a new branch for your contribution:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
  ```
- Keep commits small and meaningful. Use clear commit messages:
  ```sh
  $ git commit -m "✨ Added a new leaderboard ranking system"
  ```

### 4. Push & PR 🚀
- Push your branch:
  ```sh
  $ git push origin feature/amazing-feature
  ```
- Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into the `main` branch.
- Add a clear description of what you changed and why.
- Be patient and responsive to feedback!

## 🧪 Testing
Ensure your changes don't break anything:
```sh
$ bun run test
```
If you added a new feature, write tests for it! More tests = fewer bugs. 🐞

## 🤝 Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and inclusive.
- No toxicity. We’re here to learn and build together. 🤝
- If in doubt, ask! We love curiosity.

## 💡 Need Help?
- Check the existing documentation.
